# Project Name

First week's challenge in Technigo React/Redux Upskill course.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I pretty much wrote the code from top to bottom, step by step. I used the switch operator from the get-go as it seemed intuitive. If I had more time, I would try to handle wrong inputs by the user, for example, choosing nr. 4 on the menu. This currently breaks the program. As we were limited in what to use for this weeks challenge (no functions and objects) I would implement those things to solve the challenge more neatly.
